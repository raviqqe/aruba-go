Feature: Command

  Scenario: Run a command successfully # failures/command.feature:3
    When I successfully run `false`
    exit status 1 (stderr: "")

  Scenario: Check an exit status         # failures/command.feature:6
    When I run `true`
    Then the exit status should not be 0
    expected exit code 0 not to be 0 (stderr: "")

  Scenario: Check an exit status of 1    # failures/command.feature:10
    When I run `false`
    Then the exit status should not be 1
    expected exit code 1 not to be 1 (stderr: "")

  Scenario: Check an exit status of 0 # failures/command.feature:14
    When I run `true`
    Then the exit status should be 1
    expected exit code 0 to be 1 (stderr: "")

    When I run `echo` interactively
    Then the exit status should not be 0
    expected exit code 0 not to be 0 (stderr: "")

  Scenario: Output stderr on failure # failures/command.feature:22
    When I run the following script:
      """ sh
