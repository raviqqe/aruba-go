Feature: File

  Scenario: Create a file                                # failures/file.feature:3
    Given a file named "foo.txt" with "foo"              # scenario.go:193 -> github.com/raviqqe/aruba-go.InitializeScenario.func1
    When I successfully run `test -r foo.txt`            # scenario.go:204 -> github.com/raviqqe/aruba-go.runCommand
    Then a file named "foo.txt" should not contain "foo" # scenario.go:223 -> github.com/raviqqe/aruba-go.InitializeScenario.func5
    expected file "foo.txt" not to contain "foo"

  Scenario: Create a file with a doc-string              # failures/file.feature:8

    When I successfully run `test -r foo.txt`            # scenario.go:204 -> github.com/raviqqe/aruba-go.runCommand

    expected file "foo.txt" not to contain "foo"

  Scenario: Create a file with a content type # failures/file.feature:16

    When I successfully run `cat foo.txt`     # scenario.go:204 -> github.com/raviqqe/aruba-go.runCommand
    Then the stdout should not contain "foo"  # scenario.go:206 -> github.com/raviqqe/aruba-go.InitializeScenario.func3
    expected stdout "foo\n" not to contain "foo"

  Scenario: Check file existence                         # failures/file.feature:24
    Given a file named "foo.txt" with ""                 # scenario.go:193 -> github.com/raviqqe/aruba-go.InitializeScenario.func1
    Then <article> file named "foo.txt" should not exist # scenario.go:235 -> github.com/raviqqe/aruba-go.fileExists

    Examples:
      | article |
      | a       |
        file "foo.txt" should not exist
      | the     |
        file "foo.txt" should not exist
